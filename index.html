    I am an 18 year old male who likes DnD, video games, and Horror.
  </h2>

  <p>
    My favorite hobby right now is making DnD characters, items, classes, and races.  I like DnD a lot, and really enjoy making characters for it, as I get to think up new combos and character ideas.  I love thinking of how to push the game more, to make a character better.  DnD is my favorite game.
