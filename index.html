  I am an 18 year old male who likes DnD, video games, and Horror.

<p>
  My favorite hobby right now is making DnD characters, items, classes, and races.  I like DnD a lot, and really enjoy making characters for it, as I get to think up new combos and character ideas.  I love thinking of how to push the game more, to make a character better.  DnD is my favorite game.

      I don't watch many bad movies, ok?  So I struggle a bit when I need to make a list of my least favorites.  It also doesn't help I've not watched any movies in a while.
