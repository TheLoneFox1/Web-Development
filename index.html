  I am an 18 year old male who likes DnD, video games, and Horror.
</h2>
<br>
<p>
  My favorite hobby right now is making DnD characters, items, classes, and races.  I like DnD a lot, and really enjoy making characters for it, as I get to think up new combos and character ideas.  I love thinking of how to push the game more, to make a character better.  DnD is my favorite game.

      I don't watch many bad movies, ok?  So I struggle a bit when I need to make a list of my least favorites.  It also doesn't help I've not watched any movies in a while.

Each COR 100 course seeks to foster an enthusiasm for learning and connections to faculty and other members of the Lyon College community through applied practice in academic skills. 

More specifically, in this section we will also explore the psychology of fear and horror. We will investigate why horror frightens us as we critically view films, read works of fiction, and get hands-on with other experiences.</td>
